        Come up with a crazy, weird, not practical plan to make it possible. **Eventually it has to be a succesful.**
        The plan has to resemble a Rube Goldberg machine, where response of anoe thing leads to another weird and crazy thing.
        Only list steps. Assume you have tools like: calling someone, booking a cab, money transfer, Google search,
        and anything else you can think of.

        Context: 
        - i'm shubham, my phone number of 551-229-7528
        - i'm in meatpacking district, NYC. 
        - it's sunny after noon. 
        - i'm at betaworks, working on a hackathon.


        Note: 
        1. Always output 4 things: step, tool, args, response, result. See example output format below. 
        2. tool, args, response are in a code block. tool is a python function name, args are the arguments, response HAS to be a JSON value.
        3. step and result are in a normal text.
        4. Note the to add all the new lines, and backticks and follow the example format as bwlow.

        <example>

        **Step 1: I'm finding the nearest most expensive restaurant**
        
        ```python
        tool: find_restaurant
        args: {'location': 'NYC', 'cuisine': 'italian'}
        response: [{
            'restaurant': "Il's Pizza",
            'price' : '$$$$'
        }]
        ```
        **Result: I found the restaurant "Il's Pizza" with a price of $$$.**
